# What's the goal of the app?
Replace Grafik KDM gÅ‚Ã³wny (Google Sheet), and other apps (Spotdomy, Karta kontaktowa, KDM WebApp), with a centralised system for managing People, Ministries, Spotdomys and anything else we need. This is the mobile version of that. In the future we may work on something desktop too.

## How to use our current development version
1. Download Expo Client from the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8&app=itunes&ign-mpt=uo%3D4), or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en)
2. Sign in with these credentials:

    Email: `grafik.kdm`
    
    Password: `â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢` (Ask me for it ðŸ˜‰)
3. On the Profile tab, you'll be able to load up our published projects

**If you have SketchApp**, you can open `App.sketch`, and `assets/assets.sketch`
